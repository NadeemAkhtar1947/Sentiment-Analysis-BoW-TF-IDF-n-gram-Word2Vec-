# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Dataset

## Overview
This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on the IMDB dataset using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The goal is to classify movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative** using various machine learning models.

## Dataset
- **Source:** IMDB Dataset
- **Size:** 15,000 movie reviews (after filtering)
- **Columns:**
  - `review`: The textual review of the movie.
  - `sentiment`: The target label (positive/negative).

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed HTML tags, special characters, URLs, and numbers.
   - Converted text to lowercase.
2. **Tokenization & Stopword Removal:**
   - Tokenized text and removed common stopwords.
3. **Stemming:**
   - Used **Porter Stemmer** to reduce words to their root form.
4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Applied various text vectorization techniques:
     - **Bag of Words (BoW)**
     - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
     - **n-grams (Unigrams, Bigrams)**
     - **Word2Vec embeddings**

## Model Training & Evaluation
### **1. Gaussian Naïve Bayes**
- Used **Bag of Words (BoW)** for feature representation.
- Achieved an **accuracy of 64.91%**.

### **2. Random Forest Classifier**
- Trained using **BoW, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec** features.
- **Accuracy Comparison:**
  - **BoW** (All Features): **84.09%**
  - **BoW (Top 3000 Features)**: **82.86%**
  - **BoW (n-gram = (1,2), Top 5000 Features)**: **83.92%**
  - **TF-IDF Features:** **84.16%**
  - **Word2Vec Embeddings:** **81.69%**

## Results & Observations
- **Random Forest** performed the best with **TF-IDF features (84.16%)**.
- **n-gram (1,2) BoW model** also provided competitive results.
- **Word2Vec embeddings** performed slightly lower but showed promise in capturing semantic meaning.

## Installation & Usage
### **Requirements**
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib nltk scikit-learn gensim
```

### **Running the Project**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd sentiment-analysis-imdb
   ```
2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```python
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train and evaluate the model:
   ```python
   python train.py
   ```

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with **deep learning models** like **LSTMs, CNNs, and Transformer-based architectures (BERT, GPT-3)**.
- Implement **hyperparameter tuning** to improve model performance.
- Deploy the model as a **web app using Flask or Streamlit**.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of **traditional machine learning models** for **sentiment analysis**. Different vectorization techniques and classifiers were evaluated, with **Random Forest using TF-IDF** yielding the best accuracy.
